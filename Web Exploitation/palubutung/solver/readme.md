## TL;DR
1. Bypass nextjs `middleware` check using `x-middleware-subrequest: middleware:middleware:middleware:middleware:middleware` referenced from `CVE-2025-29927`
2. Get arbitrary `host` SSRF based on this [CVE](https://www.assetnote.io/resources/research/advisory-next-js-ssrf-cve-2024-34351) by using server action that has `redirect` with relative path (`/` prefix).
3. Get Next Action id of server action with such condition and get the `secret-key`
4. Recognize hostname parse confusion on python <= 3.11.4 based on [this](https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2023-24329-bypassing-url-blackslisting-using-blank-in-python-urllib-library-4) on `urllib.parse.urlparse` with whitespace character 
5. Bypass `endswith` check can be done in many ways, one of it with `#`
6. Leak nonce and key from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST`
7. Decrypt encrypted flag with known key and nonce using AES GCM

# important-notes
- Next.js has a very cool way when it comes to `fetching`, it defaulted to cache that request so you may have to play around with your ports on every request when you get `200`
