# Dice Game

## Description

This is a blockchain-based **dice game** that simulates traditional gambling mechanics using smart contracts. Players can start a game, place wagers, and roll virtual dice with outcomes ranging from 1 to 1000. The game is designed to be provably fair by utilizing a combination of user-generated and server-generated seeds to compute each roll deterministically.
