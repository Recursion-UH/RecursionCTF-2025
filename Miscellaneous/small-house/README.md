# Small House

## Description

So me and my friend are building a small house in Minecraft with two beds and a chest, but the house is too small to fit everything. ~~I need your help to reconstruct the house so that we can fit everything inside~~. Here is the location of the house `1, 6` in `r.0.0`.

Note:
- You don't need the Minecraft game to solve this challenge.
- Add underscore to separate words in the flag.
